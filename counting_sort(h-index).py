#Given an array of integers citations where citations[i]
#is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, r
#eturn compute the researcher's h-index.

#According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
#Ascientist has an index h if h of their n papers have atleast h citations each,
# and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

#If there are several possible values for h,
#the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
